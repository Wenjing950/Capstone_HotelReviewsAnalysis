# Capstone project：Analysis of TripAdvisor's Hotel Reviews
***
Online reviews have emerged as an increasingly important topic in the hospitality and tourism industry. Review websites such as TripAdvisor can have a significant impact on how travellers choose their accommodation and therefore have a direct impact on the revenue for hotel owners. Knowing how much stock travellers put in online reviews and reputations, it’s time to get serious about managing this sphere. Positive reviews can improve the visibility of the hotel and is free marketing for the hotel, while negative reviews highlight what can be improved in the future. The major aim of this project is to predict the rating star of hotel reviews and find the top 25 key words mentioned in polar reviews.As a result, the generated model can be advanced tools for hoteliers to evaluate and improve their hotels service performance.

This project is divided in two Jupiter notebooks with annotations as a guide:
* Data Ingestion (Gathering data through web scraping from TripAdvisor)
* Data Analysis (Regression and Natural Language Processing


Notebooks contain annotations

The first notebook covers the data processing from the TripAdvisor (https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g6999277-Waikiki_Oahu_Hawaii-Hotels.html). The major aim of this notebook is to scrape hotel reviews from Waikiki beach and create a dataset preparation to the regression model and NLP. 

Next, the Data_Analysis notebook performs the NLP and builds a regression model for predicting the star ratings of hotel reviews. In addition, WordCloud was performed by looking for top 25 key words mentioned in the polar reviews. This notebook also includes several visualisations of results.
